"""SHORT-TERM memory (checkpointer) and the shared Postgres connection pool.

The checkpointer saves the graph state after every step, keyed by thread_id (= session_id).
That is what makes the human-approval pause possible: the graph stops, the state is stored,
and a later request resumes it.

With DATABASE_URL set  -> Postgres (survives a restart).
Without DATABASE_URL   -> in memory (fine for development, lost when the app stops).
